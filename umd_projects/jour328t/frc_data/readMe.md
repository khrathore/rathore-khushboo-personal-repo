To-Do List

[ ] Get a list of all matches that a team played by year, average out their points (possibly by median?) Only for teams who are currently active and have been active for over 5 years.
[ ] Get a list of all matches played in each year, get the max score for that year for beeswarm plot
[ ] Look at teams starting in 2015 to present and see the average rankings over 1, 2, 3 and 4 years with different lines for each year
[ ] Look at years teams have been around or how long they survived for Dozerplot
[ ] Plot of where the top teams are from and how long they have been around. Bubble plot with x axis of years, y axis of avg ranking/percent of max score avg and color as State/Region, sized by world champs appearances/years around?
