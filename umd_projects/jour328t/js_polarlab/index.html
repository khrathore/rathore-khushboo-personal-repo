        <h1>Americans, Chinese, use their minutes similarly</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            After removing time spend sleeping and working for pay, people in China and
            people in America spend their days doing similar tasks. Data indicates that the average
            person in these countries spent over 100 minutes a day on television and radio
            entertainment. The key divergences are in eating and drinking, which China spends
            a half-hour more on and unpaid work or volunteering, which America spends a half-hour
            more doing.
