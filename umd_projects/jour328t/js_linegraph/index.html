        <h1>The NYT best books list has become more gender diverse</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            15 years ago, there were more woman authors than male authors on the 'New York Times'. In most of the years between 2009 and 2017, there were more
            female authors on the list than male authors. This is a stark contract to the late 20th century, where the majority of authors listed, usually by a 
            large margin, were men. This was particularly egregious in 2000, 2004 and 2007, where 80% of the listed books were by men and only 20% by women.
