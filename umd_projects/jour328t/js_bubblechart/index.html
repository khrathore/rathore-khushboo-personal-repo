        <h1>Longer might mean better when it comes to books</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Overall, books on the 'New York Times' best books list that had more pages tended to have better ratings than their short counterparts. However, many
            of these books also had fewer ratings because of their length. To quantify the number of ratings, I adjusted by using a logarithmic scale since there
            were some numbers that caused significant skewing of the data. This scale adjusted the data so that it made more sense and was a more logical comparison.
            Across all books from 1997 to 2017, 'Grant' by Ron Chernow had the highest rating (4.6/5) and had 1106 pages. It was only rated by 569 people. The overall
            best performing book was 11/22/63, by Stephen King. The book had a rating of 4.3/5, 849 pages and nearly 300,000 ratings.
