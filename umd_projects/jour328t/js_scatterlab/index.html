            Of the nine most populus countries, those with a higher Gross Domestic Product tended to have
            much higher life expectancies than their counterparts. The countries with the highest GDP were
            the United States, with an expectancy of 77 years and Japan, with an expectancy of 81 years. On
            the opposite side, Bangladesh and India had the lowest GDPs with life expectancies of 66 and 61 
            years respectively.
