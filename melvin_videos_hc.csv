For next few seconds they sit him up then he says he wants to lay back, then cops lay him down facing up and ask him whether he can breathe better. EMT arrives shortly after 7 mark and video shows several taser probes embedded in back as they sit him up and take his vitals. At 13:37 mark they start taking off taser probes off his back, he groans in pain. At around 17 mark he walks, helped by police to gurney where he is laid down.","<div style=""max-width: 640px""><div style=""position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;""><iframe src=""https://apgbl.sharepoint.com/sites/ProjectCamero/_layouts/15/embed.aspx?UniqueId=816ec447-c0b2-4118-aa4a-36e07df486be&embed=%7B%22ust%22%3Atrue%2C%22hv%22%3A%22CopyEmbedCode%22%7D&referrer=OneUpFileViewer&referrerScenario=EmbedDialog.Create"" width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen title=""5 Evenson (handcuffing).mp4"" style=""border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"" data-external=""1""></iframe></div></div>",NA,"https://apgbl.sharepoint.com/sites/ProjectCamero/Shared Documents/Video/Colorado-Video/Colorado-JMelvin-Video/5 Evenson (handcuffing).mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=NiXTH1","have video clip","TS","yes"
